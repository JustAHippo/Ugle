A search engine for the ucanet!

The [ucanet](https://ucanet.net), or the "U Create a Net" is an alternate DNS made to recreate the old internet from the ground up.

Before you contribute to Ugle!, check out [the ucanet GitHub page](https://github.com/ucanet)!
## What's done
- [x] Basic old Google UI
- [x] Domain name search
- [x] Web scraping/crawling
## What needs work
- [ ] Turn registry.txt into a database
- [ ] Cache site descriptions in database
- [ ] Use cached site descriptions in search engine
- [ ] Paginate results
## Building and Usage
As of the current state, a simple
```console
user@computer:~$ go build Ugle
```
should be enough to build and run an instance of Ugle!. This is subject to change soon as MongoDB will likely become a requirement.
